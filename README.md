Admin-Dash Project.
A project I made to practice with mainly grid layout, but also with everything I have been learning about CSS. The hardest part of this project for me was trying to get my layouts how I wanted it without the page overflowing on the sides. I also had trouble with some fiting content in the main section of my page. Overall though, I learned a lot from this project and will continue to improve upon this project, whether that is cleaning up code or adding things to this project as I continue to learn and improve upon my skills!
